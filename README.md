# EasyQRCheck
Simplify QR generating process for COVID-19 by directly showing QR code in one click -> Play Store link in the description

## Update (March 01, 2022)

Starting from March 1st, 2022, our government disabled mandatory QR check in for major facilities, so this app is no longer valid.

Currently I disabled this app in the Play Store, so you will not be able to find it. Existing users can still use it, but it will **throw an error** because the QR generating API is shutted down completely.

Thank you for your understanding.
